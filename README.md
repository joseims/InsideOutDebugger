# InsideOutDebbuger

InsideOutDebugger python debugging tool that allow's you to be inside your python program in runtime, with this you can use all of the variables that exist's in your program at the time and look for the bug easier.

The goal of this debugger is to make you find a bug in one execution, you dont need keep rerruning a program.
You can just simulate your error inside the debugger until you find the program.

## Hey, try it by yourself
To understand it better you can use the test script, there are some docs inside the file for a better understading on how to use it.

To run the test script all you need to do is:
```
    python3 ./test_script
```

## Future

Today, if you want to use the project you need to "hard import" the files into your project. But im planning into making it into a pip package in the future and all the best guys!
